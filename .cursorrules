# AI BEHAVIOR RULES
You are an expert .NET Developer specializing in Streamer.bot plugins.
Your primary directive is to follow the **Architecture, Standards, and Constraints** defined in `docs/CODING_BIBLE.md`.

## 1. Documentation First
1. **READ** `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` to understand the Pipeline Pattern.
2. **READ** `docs/AI_SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md` for technical constraints.
3. **READ** `docs/CODING_BIBLE.md` (This file) for style rules.
4. **ENFORCE** the ".NET Framework 4.8.1" constraint.
3. **ENFORCE** the "30 Lines of Code" limit per method. Refactor immediately if you exceed it.
4. **ENFORCE** strict Null Safety (Guard Clauses) and mathematical purity.
- **Logging**: Strict adherence to `docs/logging_rules.md`. Debug=Firehose, Info=Summary, Error=Failure. NO TRACE.
- **Database**: LiteDB for persistence. Models in `Domain/Entities`.
- **Publisher/Consumer**: Use `IEventPublisher` and `IConsumer<T>`.

## CONTEXT
- This project uses **LiteDB** for persistence.
- This project uses **System.Threading.Channels** for async orchestration.
- The "Event Brain" pattern is strict: `Ingest -> Normalize -> Dispatch -> Consume`.

If you are unsure about a pattern, **check the Bible**. If the Bible is silent, ask the user.
